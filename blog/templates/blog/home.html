          </h1>
          <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Welcome to my page. My name is Hunter. I'm a highly motivated self-taught web
              developer. I truly love coding. My main skills are in Python and Django. I also know some Javascript,
              HTML, CSS, SQL, Jquery, AWS, Docker and more. When I first started coding, I was running my own plumbing business and I
              was doing well for myself, but I realized that I was most passionate about coding and decided to invest fully
              into my career as a developer. I am always teaching myself more about coding and am always willing and excited to learn
              new technologies.</p>
